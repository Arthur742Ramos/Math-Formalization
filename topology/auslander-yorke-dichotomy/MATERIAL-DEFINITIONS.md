# Material imported definitions

Selected: AuslanderYorke.equicontinuous_of_stable_open_sets, AuslanderYorke.minimal_dichotomy, AuslanderYorke.minimal_not_sensitive_iff_equicontinuous.

Continuous minimal metric maps: stable-open propagation gives actual pointwise equicontinuity; sensitivity OR equicontinuity including emptybothtrue; nonsensitivity iff equicontinuity requires NonemptyX. No compact/uniform/surjective premise.

- `TopologicalSpace`: Open-set topology underlying the metric on X and actual iterate family.
- `IsOpen`: Open sets for literal sensitivity and stable sets; continuous iterated preimages and finite intersections yield a neighborhood.
- `Continuous`: f has open preimages; all finite early iterates and the hitting iterate are continuous. Explicit in all three selected results.
- `Nat.iterate`: Actual forward natural iteration: time0 identity, successor applies f; add-composition divides early and tail times. No positive-time-only equivalence claimed.
- `Filter`: Neighborhood/uniformity filter infrastructure of actual pointwise equicontinuity; no residual or asymptotic premise.
- `MetricSpace`: Genuine real-distance metric X, with topology/uniformity compatible as in pinned class fields. No compactness or global uniform-equicontinuity premise.
- `PseudoMetricSpace`: Inherited compatible pseudo-metric fields under MetricSpace, not a replacement of the stated metric hypothesis.
- `UniformSpace`: Inherited compatible uniformity used by EquicontinuousAt; family is the actual natural iterates.
- `Set.Nonempty`: Actual point membership for open U; Nonempty X is explicit only in selected exclusivity iff. Stable/dichotomy results permit empty X.
- `Metric.ball`: Real-distance open ball. Early iterates land in an epsilon-ball; exclusivity uses a ball around a chosen actual x.
- `EquicontinuousAt`: At one x, for every positive epsilon there is a positive radius controlling every actual natural iterate for all nearby y; radius may depend on x. Exact metric equivalence compiled.
- `Equicontinuous`: For every x actual EquicontinuousAt of the natural iterate family, not a global uniform-equicontinuity modulus. Empty X vacuous.
- `uniformity`: Compatible entourage filter of the metric; part of actual pointwise equicontinuity definition.
- `IsClosed`: Complement is open; retained as dependency expansion of closure and density, not a new closed-space premise.
- `closure`: Pinned closed-set closure; its open-neighborhood characterization is compiled separately. No compactness assumed.
- `Dense`: Every point lies in the closure; equivalently meets each nonempty open U. Applied to every actual forward orbit in literal Minimal.
- `Set.range`: Actual values of n mapped to f^[n]x, not an orbit closure or omega-limit set. Includes time0.
- `Finset`: Finite early-time intersection indexed by range k, internal proof dependency; no finite-index main hypothesis.
